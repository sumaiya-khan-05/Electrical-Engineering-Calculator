A project made by a Core elctrical engineering student , trying to implement Hardware Digital Logic Design (DLD) Concept in Software using DATA STRUCTURE(DSA) CONCEPT OF C++
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Electrical Engineering (EE) Calculator is a comprehensive console-based application 
developed as a Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) semester project. The project integrates core 
DSA concepts with practical Electrical Engineering utilities such as arithmetic computation, base 
conversion, logic gates, truth tables, and dynamic circuit modelling.

  3. Algorithms Implemented
-------------------------------------

3.1 Arithmetic Operations 

   • Addition 
   
   • Subtraction 
   
   • Multiplication 
   
   • Division (with zero-check) 
   
Results are displayed in a formatted table and saved to history.

3.2 Base Conversion Algorithms 
    Conversions  
     • Decimal → Binary Stack-based division 
     
     • Decimal → Octal Stack-based division 
     
     • Binary → Decimal Positional weight method 
     
     • Octal → Decimal Positional weight method
   
3.3 Sorting Algorithms 

   Algorithm Time Complexity Usage 
   
     • Bubble Sort O(n²) 
     
     • Insertion Sort O(n²) 
     
     • Merge Sort O(n log n) 
     
     • Heap Sort O(n log n) 
Sorting is applied to calculation history based on result values.

3.4 Logic Design and Circuit Simulation 
  Single Gate Truth Tables 
Supported gates: 

     • AND 
     
     • OR 
     
     • NAND 
     
     • NOT 
     
Truth tables are generated dynamically using logical operators. 

3.5 Dynamic Circuit Builder 
Process: 

1. User selects number of inputs
2. Required number of gates is auto-calculated 
3. User selects gate types 
4. Graph is constructed 
5. ANSI schematic is printed 
6. Full truth table is generated 
Supported Gates: 
AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR

The EE Calculator successfully demonstrates the practical application of Data Structures and 
Algorithms in an engineering-focused project. By integrating stacks, linked lists, trees, graphs, 
hashing, and sorting algorithms into a single cohesive system, the project bridges the gap between 
theoretical DSA concepts.
